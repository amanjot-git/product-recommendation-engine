# Product Recommendation Engine Project

## Overview
Build a recommendation system to suggest personalized products or services to customers based on their past behavior and preferences. This project involves using BigQuery for data processing and analysis, and implementing recommendation algorithms.

## Step 1: Data Collection and Storage

### User Interaction Data
- Collect data on user interactions with products or services.
- Include browsing history, purchase history, and product ratings.

### Product Information
- Gather detailed information on each product or service offered.
- Include categories, tags, descriptions, and any other relevant metadata.

### Store Data in BigQuery
- Design a schema that efficiently represents the collected data.
- Store data in tables for users, products, and interactions.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing

### Clean Data
- Ensure data consistency.
- Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers.

### Feature Engineering
- Extract useful features from the raw data.
- Create aggregated features like 'total number of interactions' or 'average rating given'.

## Step 3: Recommendation Algorithm

### Choose an Approach
- Decide between collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

### Model Implementation
- For collaborative filtering, consider matrix factorization techniques like SVD.
- For content-based filtering, consider using TF-IDF for product descriptions and user profiles.

## Step 4: Integration with BigQuery

### Data Queries
- Use SQL queries in BigQuery to fetch and preprocess data for the model.

### Model Training and Prediction
- Train your model with the prepared data.
- Consider using BigQuery ML for training directly in BigQuery.

## Step 5: Evaluation

### Choose Metrics
- Choose metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (MAP).

### Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using a separate test set.

## Step 6: Deployment and Monitoring

### Deploy the Model
- Make the recommendation system accessible to end-users.

### Monitor Performance
- Continuously monitor system performance and user satisfaction.

## Sample Code for Collaborative Filtering

```python
from surprise import Dataset, Reader, SVD, accuracy
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and prepare your data here

# Split the dataset for training and testing
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.25)

# Use SVD for collaborative filtering
algo = SVD()

# Train and predict
algo.fit(trainset)
predictions = algo.test(testset)

# Evaluate performance
accuracy.rmse(predictions)
