# Project Objective

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a sophisticated recommendation system designed to offer personalized product or service suggestions tailored to the unique preferences and historical interactions of each customer.

## Key Objectives

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Develop a system capable of suggesting products or services that align closely with individual customer preferences and past interactions.

- **Data Analysis and Processing**: Leverage BigQuery for the comprehensive processing and analysis of user interaction data, which includes but is not limited to browsing history, purchase transactions, and product ratings.

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Employ advanced recommendation algorithms, making a strategic choice between collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to optimize the system's effectiveness.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Rigorously assess the recommendation engine's accuracy and relevance by employing critical metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (MAP).

The successful execution of these objectives will ensure the delivery of a high-quality recommendation engine that enhances user experience by providing timely and relevant product suggestions.
